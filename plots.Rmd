## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
EditingIndex <- read_csv('data/EditingIndex.csv')
SraRunTable <- read_csv('data/SraRunTable.txt')
```

```{r}
EditingIndex <- EditingIndex %>% 
  dplyr::filter(StrandDecidingMethod == 'RefSeqThenMMSites') %>% 
  dplyr::select(Sample:C2TEditingIndex) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(Sample = gsub("Aligned\\.", "", Sample))

treatment_levels <- c(unique(EditingIndex_final$TREATMENT))

treatment_labels <- c("untreated", "0.5 h", "3 h", "24 h")

EditingIndex_final <- merge(
  EditingIndex,
  SraRunTable,
  by.x = 'Sample',
  by.y = 'Run'
) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
    TREATMENT = factor(TREATMENT, levels = treatment_levels, labels = treatment_labels)
  )


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(
  EditingIndex_final, aes(x = TREATMENT, y = A2GEditingIndex, color = Cell_type)
) + 
  geom_point()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
